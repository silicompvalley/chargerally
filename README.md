Starting out a web page

A "growth mindset", unlike a fixed mindset, allows for expansion of pathways towards a goal. It also allows for different options should better ones arise and ways to correct oneself if the path trails off or a mistake is made. A fixed mindset is more rigid and difficult to navigate and improve upon.

3 reminders for me to go through this fruitfully
1: I must never give up. There is always a way
2: It feels hard? It's SUPPOSED to be hard!
3: Not smart? Surprisingly, the man who came up with the IQ test himself understood that intelligence can be increased
